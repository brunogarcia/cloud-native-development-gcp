# Project 3: Fact Service with Spring Boot, Cloud Run, and Cloud SQL

- Identity Platform provides backend service, SDKs, and UI libraries that allow you to authenticate users.
- Cloud SQL is a Google service for providing managed relational databases in the cloud. It supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server.
- Cloud Run is used as the container runtime to run the containerized service.
- Spring Boot with Spring Cloud GCP.
  - When working with Spring Boot on Google Cloud, you can use the Spring Cloud GCP libraries to make it even easier to consume Google Cloud services.
  - You will use it to connect to Cloud SQL. Spring Cloud GCP provides familiar Spring abstractions over Google Cloud services.
  - Although it forms part of the Spring Cloud, you can use just the GCP libraries in your application without having to use any of the other Spring Cloud features.
